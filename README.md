### Insights from EDA

1. Age has clear outliers and missing values.
2. Females have a much higher survival rate than males.
3. Higher fare is correlated with higher survival probability.
4. There are missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
5. The dataset has meaningful relationships between Fare, Pclass, and Survived.
6. Younger passengers (children) had better survival rates.
### Conclusion

EDA helped us understand the Titanic dataset by identifying missing values, outliers, and important survival patterns. Visualizations clearly showed relationships such as gender differences in survival rate, fare effects, and age distribution. These insights are necessary before building any machine learning model.
